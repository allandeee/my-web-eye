# my-web-eye

Personal web scraper to keep an eye on some pages of interest.

> This project is truly for my personal and currently only catered to
> a single purpose - 7V keyboard check on DailyClack.
> I hope to implement a more generic class that can handle all pages,
> given minimal input. For now this achieves the original purpose.
